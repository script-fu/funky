## Introduction

The [**Manage Parasites**](../../plug-ins/folder/Manage-Parasites/) plug-in is a comprehensive practical example that demonstrates building a complete parasite management system in Script-Fu. The **standalone version** is approximately **1,100 lines** (all libraries inlined), providing a fully-featured tool for working with parasites across all three scopes in GIMP.

### What are Parasites?

Parasites are GIMP's mechanism for attaching custom data to different parts of your workspace. Think of them as **key-value pairs** that can store settings, metadata, or any other information your plug-ins need to persist.

Parasites exist in **three scopes**:

1. **Global parasites** - Attached to GIMP itself, available across all images and sessions
2. **Image parasites** - Attached to a specific image, saved with the XCF file
3. **Item parasites** - Attached to individual layers, channels, or paths

### Common Uses for Parasites

- **Plug-in settings** - Store user preferences that persist between sessions
- **Image metadata** - Track processing history, copyright info, or custom attributes
- **Layer annotations** - Mark layers with special purposes or processing flags
- **Workflow data** - Store temporary processing state or cross-plug-in communication
- **EXIF/IPTC data** - GIMP stores image metadata as parasites (e.g., `exif-data`, `gimp-comment`)

### Persistence Modes

Parasites can operate in two modes:

- **Session mode** - Data exists only during the current GIMP session (lost on exit)
- **Persist mode** - Data is saved and restored between GIMP sessions

This plug-in lets you control which mode to use when adding or modifying parasites.

## Architecture Overview

The plug-in provides four main operations, each with precise scope control:

```scheme
(define (script-fu-manage-parasites image drawables
                                    list-option
                                    remove-option
                                    remove-specific-name
                                    add-parasite
                                    parasite-name
                                    parasite-value
                                    parasite-scope
                                    persist-mode)
  ;; Main logic orchestrates four operations:
  ;; 1. List parasites based on precise option (9 choices)
  ;; 2. Remove parasites based on precise option (9 choices)
  ;; 3. Remove specific parasite by name (searches all scopes)
  ;; 4. Add new parasite with automatic scope prefixing
```

The structure is straightforward:

1. **Set attachment mode** based on persist-mode toggle
2. **List parasites** using the selected list-option
3. **Remove parasites** using the selected remove-option
4. **Remove specific** parasite by name (if enabled)
5. **Add new** parasite (if enabled)

## Nine Scope Options

Both the **List** and **Remove** operations support the same nine precision options:

### Individual Scopes

- **None** - Do nothing
- **Global** - Only global parasites (GIMP-wide)
- **Active Image** - Only the current image's parasites
- **Active Item** - Only the active layer's parasites

### Compound Scopes

- **Active Image (all layers)** - All layer parasites on current image
- **Active Image + Item + Global** - Everything related to current image plus global
- **All Open Images** - Image parasites across all open images
- **All Open Images (all layers)** - All layer parasites across all images
- **Everything** - Absolutely everything (global + all images + all items)

This granular control lets you precisely target the parasites you want to inspect or remove, from a single layer to your entire GIMP environment.

## Parasite Naming Convention

The plug-in uses **scope prefixes** to organize parasites:

- **Global parasites**: `"global-name"`
- **Image parasites**: `"image-name"`
- **Item parasites**: `"item-name"`

When **adding** parasites through this plug-in, you provide the **base name** without the prefix. The plug-in automatically adds the appropriate prefix based on your scope selection:

```scheme
;; You provide: "my-setting"
;; Plug-in creates:
;;   "global-my-setting"  (if scope is Global)
;;   "image-my-setting"   (if scope is Image)
;;   "item-my-setting"    (if scope is Item)
```

When **removing by name**, the plug-in is smart about searching - it will try all scope variations:

```scheme
;; You provide: "test"
;; Plug-in searches for:
;;   "global-test", "image-test", "item-test"
;; And removes any it finds
```

## Listing Parasites

The listing functions display parasite names and values to the Error Console:

```scheme
(define (list-global-parasites)
  (let ((parasites (global-get-parasite-list)))
    (if (null? parasites)
        (message "No global parasites found")
        (begin
          (message "=== GLOBAL PARASITES ===")
          (for-each
            (lambda (name)
              (let ((data (global-get-parasite-data name)))
                (message "  " name ": " data)))
            parasites)
          (message "Total: " (length parasites) " global parasite(s)")))))
```

Example output when listing everything:

```text
=== COMPREHENSIVE LIST (EVERYTHING) ===
=== GLOBAL PARASITES ===
  global-settings: #t
  global-last-folder: /home/user/images
Total: 2 global parasite(s)

Image: landscape.xcf
  image-copyright: Â© 2025 John Doe
  image-processed: 2025-10-17
Total: 2 parasite(s) across 1 image(s)

Image: portrait.xcf | Layer: Background
  item-blend-mode: overlay
Total: 1 parasite(s) across 3 layer(s) in 2 image(s)
```

## Removing Parasites

The removal functions mirror the listing structure, providing the same granular control:

```scheme
(define (remove-all-global-parasites)
  (let ((parasites (global-get-parasite-list)))
    (if (null? parasites)
        (message "No global parasites to remove")
        (begin
          (for-each
            (lambda (name)
              (gimp-detach-parasite name))
            parasites)
          (message "Removed " (length parasites) " global parasite(s)")))))
```

The **remove everything** option provides a clean sweep:

```scheme
(define (remove-everything-parasites)
  (remove-all-global-parasites)
  (remove-all-images-parasites)
  (remove-all-items-all-images-parasites)
  (message "Removed all parasites from everywhere"))
```

## Remove Specific by Name

The **Remove Specific by Name** feature is particularly powerful. It searches all three scopes and removes any matching parasites:

```scheme
(define (remove-parasite-by-name name image item)
  (let ((removed-count 0)
        (global-name (if (string-prefix? "global-" name) 
                         name 
                         (string-append "global-" name)))
        (image-name (if (string-prefix? "image-" name) 
                        name 
                        (string-append "image-" name)))
        (item-name (if (string-prefix? "item-" name) 
                       name 
                       (string-append "item-" name))))
    ;; Try all three scopes and report what was found
    ...
    (if (= removed-count 0)
        (message "Parasite '" name "' not found in any scope")
        (message "Total removed: " removed-count " parasite(s)"))))
```

This is useful when you know the base name of a parasite but aren't sure which scope(s) it exists in.

## Adding Parasites

The add operation automatically handles scope prefixing and data type conversion:

```scheme
(define (add-parasite-with-scope name value scope image item)
  (let ((prefixed-name (case scope
                         ((global) (string-append "global-" name))
                         ((image) (string-append "image-" name))
                         ((item) (string-append "item-" name)))))
    (case scope
      ((global)
       (set-attr prefixed-name value)
       (message "Added global parasite: " prefixed-name " = " value))
      ((image)
       (set-attr prefixed-name image value)
       (message "Added image parasite: " prefixed-name " = " value))
      ((item)
       (if item
           (begin
             (set-attr prefixed-name item value)
             (message "Added item parasite to '" 
                     (item-get-name item) 
                     "': " prefixed-name " = " value))
           (message "Error: No active layer selected"))))))
```
