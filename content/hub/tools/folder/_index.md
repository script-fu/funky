Another important tool is version control. Platforms like GitHub and GitLab allow you to store your code online, providing powerful features for managing projects, and reviewing code history. Lastly, AI tools are transforming how we approach coding. They can help bridge knowledge gaps by offering assistance, generating suggestions, and even automating some coding tasksâ€”enabling you to create working plug-ins more efficiently.
