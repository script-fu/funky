## Introduction

In these guides, I'll briefly describe the tools I use to write plug-ins and how to make the most of them. I work in Debian Stable, a distribution of Linux.

When writing code, having the right tools can make all the difference. The most essential tool to master is a proper text editor—one specifically designed for programming. My recommendation is  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) by Microsoft, which is free to download on Linux. A _syntax highlighter_ is also crucial for organizing your code into a structured, visually intuitive format.

Another important tool is version control. Platforms like GitHub and GitLab allow you to store your code online, providing powerful features for managing projects, and reviewing code history. Lastly, AI tools are transforming how we approach coding. They can help bridge knowledge gaps by offering assistance, generating suggestions, and even automating some coding tasks—enabling you to create working plug-ins more efficiently.
