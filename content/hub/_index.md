## Guides

These guides are designed for those looking to start making personal art tools via plug-ins for GIMP. Aimed at creatives, who may not be code literate, these guides offer an easy-to-follow path into coding. Coding is a wonderful way to flex the brain and relax from all that complex artwork. Plus, by making your own tools, you can customize your workflow and unlock new creative possibilities!
