## Welcome to the Documentation Hub

These guides are designed to help you navigate the diverse landscape of Linux, with a special focus on using Artbox, a powerful image editing tool built as a fork of GIMP. Whether you're new to Linux or an experienced user, you'll find a range of resources to enhance your understanding and workflow.

You'll find both simple guides and more complex instructions to suit different needs. This documentation is focused on helping you quickly find the information you need, while providing a comprehensive view of how Artbox integrates with other Linux tools and workflows.
