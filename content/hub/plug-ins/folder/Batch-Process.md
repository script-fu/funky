## Introduction

A flexible batch processing framework for Script-Fu that processes multiple images from a directory. This plug-in lets you format in a scripted manner, an entire directory of XCF images, including those in nested folders, and save the results to a customized destination folder.

The standalone version includes all library functions inlined (~850 lines), making it a complete working example that can be customized for your specific needs.

**Key Features:**
- Process files from disk or open images
- Recursive directory processing with file discovery
- Customizable processing and export functions
- ICC color profile support for CMYK export
- Proper display and image lifecycle management
- Progress reporting during batch operations

### Plug-in Menu Location

_File -> Batch Process_

### Quick Setup

Configure these values at the top of the batch-process.scm file:

- **`default-src-dir`** - Your default source directory
- **`default-dst-dir`** - Your default destination directory
- **`softproof-icc`** - Path to your ICC color profile (optional)

### Processing Modes

1. **File System Mode** - Process files from a source directory
2. **Open Image Mode** - Process currently open image(s)

The example processing function creates 50% scaled versions with sharpening appliedâ€”ideal for creating web/social media versions from high-res originals.
