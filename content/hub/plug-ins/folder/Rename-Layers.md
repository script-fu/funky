### Plug-in Menu Location

_Layer > Stack > Rename Layers_

### Keyboard Shortcut

This forces Artbox to save the shortcut for the next session. First, search for the plug-in name, and assign a shortcut.

_Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts_

Once the shortcut is working as you like, save your work then;  

_File > Quit_

When Artbox restarts, your plug-in should be activated by the assigned key.
