# Introduction

This is an attempt at an Autosave feature! It saves a numbered version of the open files that have been edited into a named folder. It does not save over the opened file. You do have to start the Autosave manually each session, it's almost an autosave.

This plug-in utilizes a set up plug-in, it helps the main plug-in do its core task. For the plug-in to function the set-up plug-in needs to be installed as well.
