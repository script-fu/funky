## Introduction

In Scheme, a vector is another fundamental data structure used to group values. Unlike lists, vectors are fixed-size, indexed collections of elements, providing faster random access and updates. Each element in a vector can be of any type, including another vector. Vectors are represented using # followed by parentheses. `#(1 2 3)`

While vectors and lists may appear similar, they serve different purposes in Scheme programming:

- Lists are more commonly used for recursive operations and dynamic structures, as their linked-node implementation allows efficient manipulation of their beginning and traversal through recursive decomposition.

- Vectors, on the other hand, are optimized for scenarios where random access to elements or updates at specific indices are required, making them more suitable for use cases like lookup tables, fixed-size configurations, or performance-critical indexed operations.

In essence, lists are the natural choice for recursive algorithms and dynamically sized data, while vectors shine when fixed-size or indexed access patterns are paramount.

### Simple Vectors

```scheme
(vector 1 2 3)
```

- Creates a vector of three elements: `1`, `2`, and `3`.

Result: **`#(1 2 3)`**

#### Accessing Vector Elements

Elements in a vector are accessed using the `vector-ref` procedure, it retrieves the element at a specified index (starting from `0`).

```scheme
(define my-vector (vector 1 2 3))
(vector-ref my-vector 0)  ; Retrieves the element at index 0
(vector-ref my-vector 1)  ; Retrieves the element at index 1
```

#### Iteration: Processing Each Element in a Vector

You can iterate through a vector using a loop or recursion. Scheme provides `vector-length` to determine the size of a vector. Hereâ€™s a simple loop to print every element in a vector:

```scheme
(define (print-elements vec)
  (let loop ((i 0))
    (if (< i (vector-length vec))
      (begin
        (gimp-message (number->string (vector-ref vec i))) ; Print the element
        (loop (+ i 1)))                                    ; Process the next index
      (gimp-message "done"))))                             ; End loop
```

- **Base Case:** If the index `i` reaches the length of the vector, stop the loop.
- **Recursive Case:** Print the element at index `i`, then increment `i`.

#### Example Usage

```scheme
(print-elements (vector 1 2 3))
```

Result:

- `"1"`
- `"2"`
- `"3"`

Result: "done"

### Mixed Vectors

Vectors can include elements of different types, including strings, booleans, numbers, other vectors, or even the result of expressions:

```scheme
(vector 42 "hello" #t (vector 1 2) (+ 3 4))
```

This creates a vector with:
  - A number (`42`)
  - A string (`"hello"`)
  - A boolean (`#t`)
  - Another vector (`#(1 2)`)
  - The result of an expression (`(+ 3 4)`, which evaluates to `7`)

Result: **`#(42 "hello" #t #(1 2) 7)`**

### Constructing Vectors

Vectors are created using `vector`, or by using `make-vector` to create a vector of a fixed size with an initial value.

```scheme
(make-vector 5 0)
```

Creates a vector of size `5` with all elements initialized to `0`.

Result: `#(0 0 0 0 0)`

### Updating Vectors

The `vector-set!` procedure updates an element in a vector at a specified index.

```scheme
(define my-vector (vector 1 2 3))
(vector-set! my-vector 1 42)  ; Sets the second element to 42
my-vector
```

Result: `#(1 42 3)`

### Checking for Vectors

The `vector?` procedure checks whether a given value is a vector.

```scheme
(vector? (vector 1 2 3))  ; Checks if #(1 2 3) is a vector
(vector? 42)              ; Checks if 42 is a vector
```

Result:

- `(vector? (vector 1 2 3))` returns `#t` (true)
- `(vector? 42)`             returns `#f` (false)

### Vectors and Pass-by-Reference Behavior

In Scheme, vectors are mutable and passed by reference. This means when you pass a vector to a function, the function can modify the original vector directly. Any changes made to the vector inside the function will be reflected outside the function as well. This behavior is useful for efficiently sharing and updating data across multiple functions, but it also requires caution to avoid unintended side effects.

#### Example: Modifying a Vector in a Function

Here's an example demonstrating how vectors are passed by reference and modified:

```scheme
(define (modify-vector vec index new-value)
  (vector-set! vec index new-value))  ; Updates the vector at the specified index

(define my-vector (vector 10 20 30))
(modify-vector my-vector 1 99)         ; Modifies the second element to 99
my-vector                              ; The original vector is now updated
```

Result: `#(10 99 30)`

#### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Create a Vector:** `my-vector` is initialized with the values `10`, `20`, and `30`.
2. **Pass to a Function:** `my-vector` is passed to `modify-vector` along with the index and new value to update.
3. **Modify in Function:** The `vector-set!` procedure updates the value at the specified index directly in the original vector.
4. **Reflect Changes:** Since vectors are passed by reference, changes made within the function are reflected in the original vector.

#### Implications of Pass-by-Reference

- **Performance:** Passing vectors by reference is efficient because it avoids copying large structures.
- **Side Effects:** Be cautious when sharing vectors across functions to avoid unintended modifications to shared data.

### Operations on Vectors

Scheme provides several built-in procedures for working with vectors, including:

- `vector-length`: Returns the number of elements in a vector.
- `vector->list`: Converts a vector into a list.
- `list->vector`: Converts a list into a vector.

```scheme
(vector-length (vector 1 2 3))         ; Returns 3
(vector->list (vector 1 2 3))          ; Converts vector to list: (1 2 3)
(list->vector (list 1 2 3))            ; Converts list to vector: #(1 2 3)
```

Result:

- `(vector-length (vector 1 2 3))` returns `3`
- `(vector->list (vector 1 2 3))` returns `(1 2 3)`
- `(list->vector (list 1 2 3))` returns `#(1 2 3)`

### Nested Vectors

Vectors in Scheme can contain other vectors as elements, creating a nested structure.

```scheme
(define nested-vector (vector (vector 1 2) (vector 3 4) (vector 5)))
```

Creates a vector of three elements, each of which is itself a vector.

Result: **`#(#(1 2) #(3 4) #(5))`**

#### Accessing Nested Data

To access elements within a nested vector, use `vector-ref` multiple times to navigate through the structure.

#### Example: Accessing Elements

```scheme
(vector-ref nested-vector 0)              ; Retrieves the first element: #(1 2)
(vector-ref (vector-ref nested-vector 0) 1) ; Retrieves the second element of the first vector: 2
```

### Summary

- **Vectors** in Scheme are fixed-size, indexed data structures.
- Use `vector` to create a vector, `vector-ref` to access elements, and `vector-set!` to update elements.
- Built-in procedures like `vector-length`, `vector->list`, and `list->vector` enable flexible operations.
- Nested vectors allow for complex, hierarchical data structures.
