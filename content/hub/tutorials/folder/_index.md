## Introduction

Let's learn how to write a Script-Fu plug-in for GIMP! Slay those repetitive tasks with a little bit of logic and strategy. We'll be going from the traditional starting point, a "Hello world!" script to deliciously complex processes.

Managing that complexity requires a solid foundation, so let's begin with the functional concepts that will be our toolkit to tackle any kind of organizational and image processing task. These include:

- Immutability: Once data is created, it can’t be changed, which helps avoid unexpected side effects.
- Pure Functions: Functions that always produce the same output for the same input and have no external side effects.
- Recursion: Solving problems by having functions call themselves.
- Higher-order Functions: Functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results.
- First-class Functions: Treating functions like any other data, meaning you can assign them to variables or pass them as arguments.

These concepts might sound a bit intense, but don’t worry, we’ll break them down with practical examples and apply them with ease. Think of them as guiding principles to simplify our work, and we’ll master them step by step!
