## Introduction

Throughout First Steps, you’ll learn key concepts of functional programming and how they apply to Script-Fu. But don't worry—these concepts are introduced in an easy-to-digest way, with plenty of examples and explanations to help you understand the principles behind the code.

Some key topics include:

- Writing your first "Hello World!" plug-in.
- Loading and using plug-ins in GIMP.
- Refactoring your code for simplicity and maintainability.
- Introducing validation and error-checking for more reliable plug-ins.
- Sending messages to various GIMP outputs (status bar, error console, dialog box).

By the end, you'll have built your own custom messaging library and have a solid foundation to continue developing more advanced plug-ins.

### What You Need

Before you get started, ensure you have the following:

- GIMP installed: [**GIMP development version**](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/commits/master?ref_type=heads) or [**Artbox**](https://script-fu.github.io/artbox/),
- A text editor: You’ll be writing and modifying code in .scm files. I recommend [Visual Studio Code](/funky/hub/tools/folder/visual-studio-code)
- [Git](/funky/hub/tools/folder/git) to keep your code backed-up and version controlled.
