Artbox is a digital painting and illustration application for Linux, specifically designed to cater to the needs of artists. It is an open-sourced, artist-adjusted version of GIMP, which allows for more flexibility and customization. The intention behind Artbox is to add new features and modify GUI interactions to make the application more fun and productive for artists. While GIMP is a powerful and versatile tool, its broad user base and design requirements can make it difficult to introduce significant changes. Artbox addresses this limitation by building on top of the GIMP codebase, adding new features that can do more than traditional plug-ins. However, managing these changes carefully is crucial to ensure that Artbox remains stable and compatible with the underlying GIMP codebase.

**Use at your own risk**, it's _not_ GIMP stable. When working in Artbox I use [incremental saving](https://script-fu.github.io/2024/05/16/IncrementalSave.html) and an [auto-save](https://script-fu.github.io/2023/04/26/AlmostAutosave.html). Artbox is hardcoded to use a different .config folder called 'Artbox'.

Artbox is powered by the [GNU Image Manipulation Program](https://www.gimp.org/) open source project.
