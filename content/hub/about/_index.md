## Ongoing Development: A Journey in Iteration

This site is very much a **work in progress**, evolving as I continue to learn and refine my understanding of Script-Fu and functional programming. I'll be adding content **slowly and carefully**, following an **iterative approach**, much like writing functional code. There may not be much here at first, but I hope youâ€™ll check back from time to time to see how things are progressing.
